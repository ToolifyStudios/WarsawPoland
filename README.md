# WarsawPoland
Official GitHub for the Warsaw, Poland Map Mod for Cities: Skylines II

## Manual Installation
1. Go to the following path in a file exploring app (WinRar, Windows File Explorer, etc.):

`C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Maps`

**If the folder does not exist, check to see if you have the [Map Installer Mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/Cities2Modding/MapInstaller/) installed.**

2. Drag and Drop (or just Copy) the following two files into the folder:
   `Flatland.cok` and `Flatland.cok.cid`

**Important: Due to some technical errors, please download the `.cok` and the `.cok.cid` files from Thunderstore, just click on "Manual Install" as that has all the files needed, GitHub is not willing to work.**

3. You should be done! Hop into the game (with your mods enabled) and create a new game, and then pick the map! Have fun!
